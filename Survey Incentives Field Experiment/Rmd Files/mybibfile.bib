	abstract = {The effect of various large monetary incentives was examined in a mail survey of owners of small construction subcontracting companies. The sample was randomly divided into seven groups, each of which received either a different monetary amount enclosed with the first mailing (\$1 cash, \$5 cash, \$5 check, \$10 check, \$20 check, or \$40 check) or an offer of a \$50 check to be sent once the questionnaire was returned. These groups were compared against each other and against a control group that did not receive an incentive. Three follow-up mailings were sent to the nonrespondents in each group. The results indicate that \$1 significantly increased the response rate over the no incentive control condition regardless of the number of mailings. The response rate also increased significantly as the incentive amount increased from \$1 to \$5 and from \$5 to \$20. There was a nonsignificant difference in response rate between the \$5 check and \$5 cash groups. The promise of \$50 did not result in a significantly higher response rate than the control group. Discussion includes a cost-benefit analysis of the incentives, as well as a section about the increased "favorability" of respondent toward the survey sponsor within the large incentive groups.},

This research note describes results of an experiment using a nationally representative sample of 4,725 residential addresses to test a new way of letting mail recipients know their letter contains cash and is therefore worth opening: an envelope with a window revealing \$5, so the cash is clearly visible from outside the sealed envelope. We also tested the USPS for evidence of theft, and we compared First Class and Priority Mail postage. We found no evidence of theft. We found no difference in response rates between Priority Mail and First Class, making First Class much more cost-effective, and we found that visible money increased the response rate to a mail survey from 42.6 to 46.9 percent, at no significant cost.},

	abstract = {Background 
        The generalizability of data derived from patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) depends largely on the proportion of the relevant population that completes PROM surveys. However, PROM survey responses remain low, despite efforts to increase participation. Social incentives, such as the offer to make a charitable donation on behalf of the survey respondent, have generally not been effective where online surveys are concerned, but this has not been extensively tested in medicine.
        Questions/purposes 
        (1) Do personalized social incentives increase response rates or response completeness for postoperative PROM surveys in an orthopaedic population? (2) Are there demographic factors associated with response and nonresponse to postoperative PROM surveys? (3) Are some demographic factors associated with increased response to social incentive offers?
        Methods 
        Participants were selected from an institutional orthopaedics database. Patients were older than 18 years, had an email address on file, and had undergone one of the following procedures 1 to 2 years ago: Achilles tendon repair, ACL reconstruction, meniscectomy, hip arthroscopy, TKA, or THA. Of 4685 eligible patients, 3000 (64\%) were randomly selected for inclusion in the study. Participants were randomized to one of four groups: (1) control: no incentive (n = 750); (2) patient donation: offer of a USD 5 donation to provide medical supplies to a pediatric orthopaedic patient (n = 751); (3) research donation: offer of a USD 5 donation to a procedure-specific research program (n = 749); or (4) explanation: explanation that response supports quality improvement (n = 750). The four groups did not differ regarding patient age, gender, race, procedure type, or time since procedure. All patients were sent an email invitation with the same PROM survey link. The proportion of patients who responded (defined here as the response rate) was measured at 4 weeks and compared between intervention groups. We used a logistic regression analysis to identify demographic factors associated with response while controlling for confounding variables and performed subgroup analyses to determine any demographic factors associated with increased response to social incentives.
        Results 
        There was no difference in the overall response rate (research donation: 49\% [353 of 725], patient donation: 45\% [333 of 734], control: 45\% [322 of 723], explanation: 44\% [314 of 719]; p = 0.239) or response completeness (research donation: 89\% [315 of 353], patient donation: 90\% [301 of 333], control: 89\% [287 of 322], explanation: 87\% [274 of 314]; p = 0.647) between the four groups. Women (odds ratio [OR], 1.175; p = 0.042), older patients ({\textless} 58 years: OR, 1.016 per 1-year increase; p = 0.001; 58-64 years: OR, 1.023 per 1-year increase; p {\textless} 0.001; {\textgreater} 64 years: OR, 1.021 per 1-year increase; p {\textless} 0.001), and white patients (OR 2.034 compared with black patients, p {\textless} 0.001) were slightly more likely to respond, after controlling for potential confounding variables such as gender, age, race, and procedure type. In subgroup analyses, men (research donation: 49\% [155 of 316], patient donation: 45\% [146 of 328], control: 40\% [130 of 325], explanation: 39\% [127 of 325]; p = 0.041) and patients younger than 58 years (research donation: 40\% [140 of 351], control: 35\% [130 of 371], patient donation: 32\% [113 of 357], explanation: 27\% [93 of 340]; p = 0.004) were slightly more likely to respond to the research donation than those with other interventions were.
        Conclusions 
        Despite small effects in specific subgroups, personalized social incentives did not increase the overall response to postoperative orthopaedic surveys. Novel and targeted strategies will be necessary to reach response thresholds that enable healthcare stakeholders to use PROMs effectively.

However, evidence on the response rate effect of donation incentives and especially altruistic and egotistic text appeal interventions is sparse and ambiguous. Via a randomized survey experiment among 6,162 members of an online survey panel, this article shows how low-cost incentives and cost-free text appeal interventions may affect the survey response rate in online panels. The experimental treatments comprise (a) a cash prize lottery incentive, (b) two donation incentives that promise a monetary donation to a good cause in return for survey response, (c) an egotistic text appeal, and (d) an altruistic text appeal. Relative to a control group, we find higher response rates among recipients of the egotistic text appeal and the lottery incentive. Donation incentives yield lower response rates.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this study was to examine the correlation between online survey non-response and various demographic factors, including gender. Studies have shown that trends exist with regard to who responds to surveys, at least with regard to traditional modes of survey administration. Reports suggest that many demographic and other correlates with non-response to online surveys may indeed mirror those of more traditional modes of survey administration. However, the influence of such a basic demographic factor as gender on online survey response behavior is unclear. In this study, a record-linking technique was employed to compare the gender of online survey respondents directly to available demographic data of all members of a sampling frame, thus allowing comparison of demographic information of both respondents and non-respondents. The sampling frame, which consisted entirely of university faculty members of a large research university in the southeastern United States with a full-time faculty of approximately 1000, was specifically chosen to minimize the effect of other potential correlates to non-response behavior, such as education level, Internet access, geographic location, occupation, and income. Pearson's chi square analysis showed a significant relationship between gender and survey response rates: female faculty members contributed disproportionately to the respondent data set. One possible explanations for the observations is that the observed differences in female and male faculty response rates is a product of differences in female and male values operating in a gendered online environment. Results of this study suggest that researchers should not assume that response behavior toward online surveys, and therefore data gathered from online surveys, is free of gender bias.
