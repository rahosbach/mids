# Incentives and Engagement: A Field Experiment to Evaluate the Effect of Survey Incentives on MIDS Alumni
This field experiment and final report constitute the final project for the MIDS W241: Experiments and Causal Inference course.  My key roles on our four-person team included:

- writing the Python script to scrape the email addresses and graduation dates of the MIDS alumni from the UC Berkeley School of Information website (using Selenium),
- conducting exploratory data analysis and developing the initial causal models using R,
- authoring the abstract, introduction, and methodology sections of the final report, and
- acting as the primary editor/reviewer for all report sections.

**Abstract:**
Studies have shown a variety of effects from different incentives to increase survey response rates. We conduct an experiment to test whether a direct financial incentive or a philanthropic incentive cause increased survey response rates among 1,105 alumni of the UC Berkeley I Schoolâ€™s Master of Information and Data Science program. Surprisingly, we find that both incentives caused lower survey response rates, with the direct financial incentive causing significant intent-to-treat and complier average causal effects of approximately -6% and -10%, respectively. While these results likely do not generalize beyond the current population of MIDS alumni that comprised our sample frame, future research that evaluates different incentive levels and incentive types on survey response rates may prove fruitful for determining more general best practices for increasing survey response rates among graduate school alumni.
