# Time Series Modeling and Forecasting of Mauna Loa Atmospheric CO<sub>2</sub> Concentration
This final report contains the work that my partner and I completed in analyzing the time series of atmospheric CO2 concentration from the Mauna Loa Observatory.  Our work consisted of initial EDA followed by developing different types of time series models to fit the data.  The final model we used for forecasting was a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model.  With this model we developed short- and long-term forecasts and evaluated the forecasts using a variety of forecast performance metrics.

For this project, my partner and I both worked through the entire analysis alone and then we combined the best pieces of our individual work into this final report.  As a result, I performed work covering every aspect of this final report (from EDA to time series forecasting and report authoring).
