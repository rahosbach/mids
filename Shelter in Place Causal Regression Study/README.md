# Causal Study of Shelter-in-Place Orders on Unemployment
This is the final lab report my team authored for the MIDS _Statistics for Data Science_ course.  In this report we used linear regression to assess if COVID-19 state-level shelter-in-place orders caused increased unemployment.  The metric we used as our outcome variable is the state-level change in average unemployment between February 2020 (before any states issued shelter-in-place orders) and April-June 2020.  We evaluated three separate regression models, each of which had a statistically significant positive coefficient for our primary explanatory variable: a binary indicator of whether or not the state ever initiated a shelter-in-place order.  However, the report also details an investigation of five omitted variables, all of which we believe would lead to reducing the coefficient on this explanatory variable (potentially even reducing the coefficient enough to make it negative).

In addition to acting as the primary R coder for this project, I also lead the omitted variable bias analysis.
